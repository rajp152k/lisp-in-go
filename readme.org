#+title: Writing a Lisp in Go

* Incentives
This is a pedagogical exercise in understanding lisp and expressing its internals in golang.

The basics of any program's journey from being source to being executed:
 - being Lexed
 - being Parsed
 - being Evaluated in an Environment

I plan to evolve the language over time, iterating with minor upgrades.

* Progress Log
** 0x22DA : Token streams
- starting out with the basics
- I only need to be able to read in whitespaces, LParens, RParens, and symbols
- a primal TDD approach sounds good to being with
- might have to pull out regexp matching: reading character by character might be an interesting experience in itself though
