#+title: Writing a Lisp in Go

* Incentives
This is a pedagogical exercise in understanding lisp and expressing its internals in golang.

The basics of any program's journey from being source to being executed:
 - being Lexed
 - being Parsed
 - being Evaluated in an Environment

I plan to evolve the language over time, iterating with minor upgrades.
